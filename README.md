**⚠️ Important Caution**

Check your template: Before using any solution, make sure to compare it with your assignment template. Minor differences in formatting or structure may cause issues.

Verify the question: Do not directly copy-paste answers. Some assignments may have similar but slightly different questions. Always read the question carefully before using the solution.

**Usage**

Browse the relevant assignment folder.

Open the solution file in Python or your preferred editor.

Compare and adapt to your own template before submission.
